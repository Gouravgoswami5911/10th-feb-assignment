    "The Python built-in function open() is used to open a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (read-only mode): This is the default mode when a file is opened in Python. In this mode, the file can only be read and \n",
    "    you cannot write or modify its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode): In this mode, you can write to the file. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated (i.e. \n",
    "                                                                                                                       deleted),\n",
    "    and if it does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode): In this mode, you can add new data to the end of the file. If the file already exists, the new data will \n",
    "    be appended to the end of the file, and if it does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode): In this mode, a new file is created and opened for writing. If the file already exists, an \n",
    "    error will be raised, and the file will not be opened. This mode is useful to prevent \n",
    "    overwriting existing files by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (binary mode): This mode is used when working with binary files, such as images or executable files. When a file is opened \n",
    "    in binary mode, the data is read and written in binary format, rather than text format.\n",
    "    \n",

    "#Question2 : Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close a file in Python. When you open a file, the operating system allocates some resources,\n",
    "such as memory and disk space, to the file. Closing the file releases these resources back to the operating system, making them\n",
    "available for other processes to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: As mentioned above, closing a file releases the resources that were allocated to it, which helps to\n",
    "    optimize the performance of the operating system and prevent resource exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: When you write to a file, the data may not be immediately written to the disk. It may be temporarily stored \n",
    "    in a buffer in memory. If you do not close the file, this data may be lost if the operating system crashes or if the \n",
    "    program terminates abnormally. Closing the file ensures that the data is written to the disk and is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "File lock: When you open a file for writing, it is locked, and other processes cannot access it until it is closed. This\n",
    "    is an important feature for ensuring that multiple processes do not try to modify the same file at the same time, which \n",
    "    could result in data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good programming practice: Closing a file is considered a good programming practice, as it makes the code more readable and \n",
    "    maintainable. When you use the with statement, as shown in the previous examples, the file is automatically closed when \n",
    "    the block of code is exited, which makes it easier to manage the file resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "In summary, closing a file is an important step in managing file resources and ensuring the integrity of the data.\n",
